        &nbsp;
        <p> - Bugra Arkin is he founder and owner of Dolan's Uyghur Cuisine in East Los Angeles, California.</p>
        &nbsp;
        <p> - Arkin moved to the United States in 2015 to attend graduate school at the University of Southern California.</p>
        &nbsp;
        <p> - Raised in Urumqi, Arkin did not see many people getting detained and sent to "re-education camps". It wasn't until two years after he moved to the US, people were getting detained in large amounts.</p>
        &nbsp;
        <p> - Arkin's last visit to China was in 2017, where he had a school project in Beijing. After the project was completed, Bugra went to visit his home of Urumqi where he was detained and spent two nights in a police station. Luckily, Bugra was released because the police chief of that station was the brother of his friend. Since then, Bugra never returned to the country.</p>
        &nbsp;
        <p> - Bugra opened his restaurant to spread awareness about Uyghur culture with the belief that food is be best way to spread culture.</p>
        &nbsp;
        <p> - Apart of the small Uyghur community in Los Angeles, Arkin and other Uyghurs have festivals, political campaigns, and protests to celebrate and help their people and loved ones back home.</p>
