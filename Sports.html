        &nbsp;
        <p> - √ñzil was warned of the consequences he would face by posting this tweet but still followed through and posted.</p>
        &nbsp;
        <p> - By posting this tweet, √ñzil would have to completely remove China from his market.</p>
        &nbsp;
        <p> - Fearlessly, √ñzil went forward with what he wanted to do and posted the tweet.</p>
        &nbsp;
        <h4> China's response to √ñzil's tweet: </h4>
        &nbsp;
        <ol>
            <li>‚Ä¢ Chinese sports broadcasters refused to say √ñzil's name on the air.</li>
            <li>‚Ä¢ Searching for his name on the internet would bring up errors.</li>
            <li>‚Ä¢ √ñzil's fan club in China consisiting of 50,000 members dissolved.</li>
            <li>‚Ä¢ √ñzil was removed as a character in video games.</li>
        </ol>
        &nbsp;
        <h4>The Impact of Speaking Up</h4>

    <p> - Two of √ñzil's teammates, Pierre Emerick Aubameyang and Hector Bellerin both spoke up on different issues than √ñzil.</p>
    &nbsp;
    <p> - Aubameyang speaking on the police violence in Nigeria and Bellerin speaking on the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>
    &nbsp;
    <p> - Both Aubameyang and Bellerin both were praised for their activism while √ñzil was shut out. Making it seem like he chose the wrong topic to speak on.</p>
    &nbsp;
    <p> - The effect this tweet √ñzil posted had on his relationship with Arsenal Football Club and his career was massive. As time went by, √ñzil was slowly pushed out of the club. With pay cuts and no contract renewal, Mesut √ñzil's time with the club was over.</p>
