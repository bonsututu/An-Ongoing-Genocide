        <p> - During the 1950s, another Chinese ethnic group names the Han began moving into the Xinjiang region in large numbers.</p>
            <p>That number continued to grow largely decade after decade.</p>
        &nbsp;
        <p> - By the time it was the late 20th century (1990s), the Han had populated 2/5 of the Xinjiang region's population.</p>
        &nbsp;
        <p> - As time went by and the Han population began to grow, economic disputes and ethnic tensions began to emerge.</p>
        &nbsp;
        <p> - Resulting from the tensions and disputes came many protests and riots.</p>
        &nbsp;
        <p> - One riot that stood out was in July of 2009, where about 200 people were killed and 1,700 were injured.</p>
        &nbsp;
        <p> - Violent attacks like stabbings and suicide bombings continued to occur frequently.</p>

        &nbsp;
        <p> - Chinese authorities began to respond to these violent attacks by suspecting Uyghurs as separatists and dissidents.</p>
        &nbsp;
        <p> - Cameras and checkpoints were put in place in areas of Xinjiang with dense Uyghur populations.</p>
        &nbsp;
        <p> - The CCP (Chinese Communist Party) also began incarcerating Uyghurs without trial and placing Uyghurs into internment camps where Uyghur relgious practices are being surpressed.</p>
